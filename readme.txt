Hello user, 

This is a manual for your new Social Media app. 

In order to understand how this program works, here are some instructions: 

- You can view the user1data.txt file where you can find all the other users that exist in our system. With this information, you can follow, view or even like their posts. 

- Once you view the user1data.txt you can proceed to run our SocialMedia program. 

These are the options that you have:

a. Login to your account
b. Create a new account
c. Exit the program

You can create your own account or login into a previous one. 

if you are creating a new account do not forget to create a new login name (this will be the one you enter if you exit the program and want to login back again). Then, create your password and your name. 

Once you login, you will automatically see the last post you posted and any current posts from people you follow. 

Also, you will get a main menu as the one bellow: 

a. Like a post
b. Add a new post
c. View your list of followers
d. View your list of following
e. Follow a user
f. View your following's posts
g. Log out


Here are some instructions on how they work: 

a. Once you select this option you will have to enter the post number (which is shown to the left of the posts, if not sure what posts you looking for, select option f, which it's explanation of how it works is down bellow) of the post you want to like. If this post exists then you have successfully liked the post. 

b. Once you selected this option you will have to write any desired caption for your post. 

c. Once you selected this option, a list of followers will appear in the screen.

d. Once you selected this option, a list of people you are following will appear in the screen. Then, you can write the user's name that you want to view recent posts, if not, just type 0 to go back to the main menu. 

e. For this option, you can visit the file "user1data.txt" to view other users that exist in our program. Once you know their username you can type it and you have successfully followed someone new!

f. Once you selected this option, the system will automatically display recent posts of people you are currently following. 

g. Select this option if you'd like to log out from your profile.
